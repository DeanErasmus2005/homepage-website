            <h5>I went to 3 different highschools. First I went to a public school , but it too was overwhelming and afterwards i went to a private school and then ultimately graduated highschool online.
                I am an <b>extremely</b> hardworking person and always strive to be the best version of myself and like to encourage other people to do the same. I am born and raised in South Africa , but after studies i would love to go live abroad as I believe it would be more beneficial for me.
